# Tic-tac-toe
Some goals for this project:
- Have as little global code as possible
- Make use of factory function and module
- Gameboard made in grid
- Have an intro screen
- If ambitious make an ai
- Make the site responsive

#Outcome of this project

Learned and used module pattern. Not satified for how I coded the winning condition code. The part to check the diagonal was hardcoded. Lot of code can be improved. I am very proud of the design of this project, tried to stick to a color code and made it pretty as much as possible and added some neat animation. The site is responsive but not fully optimized for all platform. I need to learn more about code structure overall.
